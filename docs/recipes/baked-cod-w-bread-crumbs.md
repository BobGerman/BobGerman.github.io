# Baked Cod with Bread Crumbs and Butter

adapted from https://cookingwithmammac.com/baked-cod-with-bread-crumbs/
(half recipe)

- 1 lb cod (or similar fish) fillets

- 1/2 cup bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup grated cheese
- 1 1/2 Tbsp white wine
- 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 Tbsp fresh chopped parsley
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp paprika

- 1/2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 1/2 Tbsp butter (I prefer unsalted)

1. Preheat oven to 400; line a baking sheet w/foil and grease w/cooking oil

2. Rinse and dry the cod. Cut into serving portions and place on baking sheet

3. Mix the other ingredients (except for the butter and lemon juice) in a bowl, ensuring bread crumbs are uniformly dampened

4. Top all the fish pieces with the breadcrumb mixture; pat it down and keep piling it all on until no breadcrumbs remain

5. Slice butter into squares and top each piece with a butter square
Sprinkle with paprika

6. Bake for fish flakes; the recipe says 25 min but I found 10 minutes was perfect with medium thick fish that had been at room temperature
