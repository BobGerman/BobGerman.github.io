# Miso-Glazed Eggplant

adapted from https://www.justonecookbook.com/miso-glazed-eggplant/

## Ingredients

### Glaze

 * 3 Tbsp miso
 * 1/2 Tbsp sugar
 * 1 Tbsp mirin
 * 1/2 Tbsp sake (or more if needed to thin chunky miso)

### Eggplant

 * 3 Japanese eggplants
 * 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil

### Garnish
 * 1 green onion/scallion
 * toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Gather ingredients. Set oven rack ~7 in from the top heating element and preheat oven to 425. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

2. Make the glaze. First combine the miso and sugar in a small bowl, then add mirin and sake to make a slurry. Add more sake or water if needed to reach preferred consistency.

3. Cut stems off eggplants and cut in half lengthwise. Score the inside surfaces with slices 1/8" apart and 1/8" deep; running a mandolin blade over them works well. Score in 2 diagonal directions so the eggplant is covered with a diamond pattern.

4. Soak eggplant in water for 10 min to remove astringency, then blot with paper towels and place face up on the parchment. Paint the open surfaces with toasted sesame oil, then flip face down on the parchment.

5. Bake at 425 for 15 minutes until the eggplant fhesh is soft and the skin is slightly shriveled.

6. Remove the eggplant and preheat the broiler

7. Turn the eggplants cut side uo and paint with the glaze. Cover the surface completely. You can save any extra glaze for another time.

8. Broil for 3-5 min until the glaze begins to bubble and carmalize

9. Serve with the sesame seeds and chopped scallions
