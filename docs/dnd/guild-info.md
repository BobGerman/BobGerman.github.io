At the crossing of the Old North Road and Kings March sits the aptly named Crossroads Inn, a welcome sight to weary travelers. The innkeeper, Orrin Moonshard, is an elderly wood elf with white hair. 

On one side, through an inconspicuous entrance, is the Guild Hall, the meeting place of the Guild of the Golden Dragon. The Guild is a loose alliance of adventurers who work together to keep the roads safe from monsters, bandits, and other threats. They also sometimes help neighboring settlers and carry out special missions, which often bring rich rewards. Orrin is the defacto organizer of the Guild, however he never leaves the inn as he is its sole proprietor. He often catches wind of adventures and informs the Guild members. Orrin maintains a flock of messenger pigeons in a coop behind the inn which he uses to communicate with the members and call them together.

The campaign is an anthology of one-shot to 2 or 3-shot adventures. This allows for reduced commitment to make every session, and for more variety at the expense of a big story arc.
