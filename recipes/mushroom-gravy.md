# Kate's Mushroom Gravy

Kate found this recipe and adapted it quite a bit so here is the update. I love that you can make a very savory gravy without drippings; this is great on pork roast or turkey!

## Ingredients

### Mushroom mixture:

 - 1 Tbsp olive oil
 - 3 Tbsp unsalted butter (3/8 stick)
 - 1 1/2 Tbsp fresh garlic, finely minced
 - 1/8 tsp salt

### Gravy:

 - 2 Tbsp butter (1/4 stick)
 - 4 Tbsp all-purpose flour
 - 2 cups homemade chicken stock
 - 3 Tbsp white wine (Pinot Grigio preferred)
 - 1/4 tsp black pepper
 - 1-2 tsp powdered sage
 - Dash of gravy master (optional)

## Instructions

### Mushroom mixture:

1. Clean and slice the mushrooms about 1/8" 
2. Add oil and butter to a large skillet and melt over medium-high heat
3. Add mushrooms and cook covered until done through, stirring occasionally. About half way thru stir in the salt; encourage the mushrooms to juice out.
4. Remove from heat and set side

### Gravy:

1. In a small sauce pan, melt butter, then add the flour and stir constantly for 1 1/2 min to make a roux
2. Slowly whisk in the chicken stock, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
3. Add the wine and pour off the liquid from the mushrooms; continue to whisk until it thickens uniformly
4. Add the pepper, sage, and mushroom mixture and cook for 3-5 min over medium-low heat
5. To get a darker color, stir in a small amount of gravy master
