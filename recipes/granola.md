# Bob's New England Style Granola

This home-made granola is less expensive and, with no added oils, most likely less caloric than what you get in the store. Plus you can customize it with your favorite ingredients!

This is a blend of several recipes I found online, plus I made several batches to fine tune. I just made up the New England part, but it does have maple syrup so why not? Don't even think about using that fake "maple" pancake syrup; if you can't get the real thing I'd try another natural liquid sweetener such as honey or brown rice, agave, date, or brown sugar syrup, adding a bit of liquid if it's too viscous.

## Dry ingredients

 - 2 cups organic rolled oats (the slow cooking kind)
 - 1 cup organic puffed wheat
 - 1 cup organic puffed rice
 - 1 tsp ground cinnamon

Select 4-6 of the following "fun" ingredients, 1/4 cup each:

  - raw pepitas (often called pumpkin seeds but they're actually from squash) or sunflower seeds
  - chopped raw walnuts, pecans, almonds, or hazel nuts
  - slivered almonds `*`
  - raisins, craisins, dried blueberries`*` and/or cherries

`*` these tend to overcook so set them aside and add them only for the last 15 min of baking

## Wet ingredients

 - 2 egg whites gently stirred
 - 3/8 cup maple syrup, dark preferred
 - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 320 degrees.

2. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl except for any that might overcook such as slivered almonds and dried blueberries.

3. Mix the wet ingredients to blend them without whipping the egg whites.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir with a large spoon until everything is uniformly moist.

5. Spread the mixture in a cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes at 320 degrees. (For easy cleanup, line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil.)

6. Remove cookie sheet and add any remaining ingredients. With a spoon or spatula, turn over all the granola, breaking up any oversized chunks, and return to the oven for an additional 15 minutes.

7. Remove from oven transfer granola to a bowl to cool. Package in an air-tight container.

## Why organic?

Did you know that in 2018 the [Environmental Working Group (EWG) detected significant quantities of Glyphosphate (Roundup weed killer) in oatmeal?](https://www.health.com/nutrition/pesticides-in-oatmeal)
EWG says this is a cause for concern, but the food manufacturers in question claim it's no problem. They wouldn't lie about that kind of thing, right?

You decide for yourself, but we have only organic oats in our kitchen! [Bob's Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Oats](https://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-regular-rolled-oats.html) are my current favorite.
